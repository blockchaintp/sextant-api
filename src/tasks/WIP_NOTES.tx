I'd like to move the TaskProcessor and Task definitions closer to the tasks directory.
Should I use a union type for the yeild return values?
Is "<reasource><action>TaskInterface" a good name for the wrapper around the task generator function definitions?
When is it correct to use the term 'params' vs. 'arguments'? Are they interchangeable terms or are params a subset of arguments?
